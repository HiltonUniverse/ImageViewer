This is an application that is used to view and add annotations to a selected image.
There is also a basic used of OpenCV to warp images that are tilted (yet to work more on this).
Some of the features this application provides are:
* Grid view of images to select from (supports both Drag/drop and importing from folder).
* Actions such as: Save, undo/redo, drawing on top of a selected image, convert image to (grayscale, binary, inverse binary) and warp images using openCV.
* This also has an action to share image (yet to implement).
* Serialization feature is also available.
* User can draw annotation on top of a selected image and play around with it (undo/redo, select and move).
