Some of the features this application provides are:
* Grid view of images to select from (supports both Drag/drop and importing from folder).
* Actions such as:
  * save
  * undo/redo
  * drawing on top of a selected image
  * convert image to (grayscale, binary
  * inverse binary) and
  * warp images using openCV
* This also has an action to share image (yet to implement).
* Serialization feature is also available.
* User can draw annotation on top of a selected image and play around with it (undo/redo, select and move).
